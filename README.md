 Creme Brulee, also known as burned cream is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a texturally contrasting layer of hardened caramelized sugar. It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. The custard base is traditionally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes garnished with fruit. The difficulty level of the recipe of this dish has been rated intermediate and it takes around 3 hrs and 30 mins to make this dish. The recipe I have given results in 6 servings of Creme Brulee. It takes around 15 mins to prepare for this dish, and it needs to cook for 1 hr while cooling for 2 hrs and 15 mins. It is one of my favorite desserts and I hope you enjoy!
